# Dark Heresy 2E - ZoneBrew

A homebrewed version of the excellent module maintaned by Vendare and created by moo-man.

## Current Differences
### Automation
Automation for Flak armour's (slightly homebrewed) AP bonus against explosive damage (it's normally against blast weapons, but this makes more sense IMO). 

## Install
1. Go to the setup page and choose **Game Systems**.
2. Click the **Install System** button, and paste in this [manifest link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RHSvenson/DarkHeresy2E-FoundryVTT-ZoneBrew/master/system.json)
3. Create a Game World using the Dark Heresy system.
